        <h3>Pop culture and feminism</h3> 

        <p> 
            

            Ladies and gentlemen, hello today we are going to talk about pop culture and feminism. Pop culture plays an essential role in our perception of the world, our education and our relationship to ourselves and to others. It is a political and social issue. It takes up and encompasses societal issues and conveys images that condition us. For this we will take two rival publishing houses with various heroines and villains. I present you the DC and MARVEL houses through which we will see essentially the creation and the evolution of the characters.

        </p>

            <h3>DC</h3><p>
                 

                First of all let's start with the first heroines that have lasted until now. Wonder Woman created by Charles Moulton, whose real name was William Moulton Marston. "Even girls won't want to be girls. As long as our female archetypes lack strength, vigour and power. As they don't want to be girls. They don't want to be tender, submissive, peaceful as good women are. The great qualities of women have been despised because of their weakness.</p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
               
The logical remedy is to create a female character. With all the strength of Superman plus the allure of a good and beautiful woman. So he created one of the first feminist heroines fighting for equality, democracy and faith in humanity. Wishing first of all to straighten out the criminals as well as the crime. Unfortunately, when her creator died, Wonder Woman's goals changed. In 1972 she was named a symbol of the feminist revolution

            <h3>MARVEL</h3>  <p> 

               
Marvel had to wait until 1964 for the first comic book entirely dedicated to a woman. This woman being Black Widow who was first a villain before joining the good guys team. Captain Marvel or Scarlet Witch, Tornado, Invisible Woman, Mystique or Gamora.  </p>

                </figure>


                <p>
                    Unfortunately at Marvel due to the late arrival of the heroines the essential of the feminists had already been conquered by DC. That doesn't mean they are losing their fight for gender equality in comics. It just means that the fight was already well underway. </p>
