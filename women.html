            <h3>Pop culture and feminism</h3>

        <p> 
            

            Ladies and gentlemen, hello today we are going to talk about a<span class="complex"> pop culture </span>
             and 
             <span class="complex"> feminism</span>.Pop culture plays an essential role in our perception of the world, our education and our
              relationship to ourselves and to others. It is a political and social issue. 
              It takes up and encompasses societal issues and conveys images that condition 
              us. For this we will take two rival 
            deux<span class="complex">publishing houses </span>  with various heroines and 
            villains. I present you the DC and MARVEL houses through which we will 
            see essentially the creation and the evolution of the characters.
        </p>

            <h3>DC</h3><p>
                 

                First of all let's start with the first heroines that have lasted until now. 
                Wonder Woman created by Charles Moulton, whose real name was William Moulton Marston. "Even girls won't want to be girls.
                 As long as our female <span class="complex">archétypes </span>  féminins 
                 manqueront 
                 de force, de vigueur et de puissance. Comme 
                 elles ne veulent pas être des filles. Elles ne 
                 veulent pas être tendres, soumises, pacifiques  lack strength, vigour
                  and power. As they don't want to be girls. They don't want to be tender, 
                  submissive, peaceful as good women are. The great 
                 qualities of women have been despised because of their weakness. 
                 The logical remedy is to create a female character. With all the strength 
                 of Superman plus the allure of a good and beautiful woman. So he created one
                  of the first
                  feminist heroines fighting for equality, democracy and faith in
                 <span class="complex"> humanity</span>.  Wishing first of all 
                 to straighten out the criminals as well as the crime. Unfortunately,
                  when her creator died, Wonder Woman's goals 
                  changed. In <span class="complex">1972 </span>  she was named a symbol
                   of the
                   feminist revolution
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>
                It is therefore understandable that our heroine was 
                born for young women but has taken an important 
                place in all our hearts. A press release will tell us:
                <cite>"Wonder Woman was conceived by Dr. Marston to promote a model 
                    of strong, free and courageous femininity among 
                    young people, to combat the idea that women are inferior 
                    to men, and to inspire young girls to be confident and successful
                     in sports, activities and professions monopolized by men. 
                </cite>

            <h3>MARVEL</h3>  <p> 

                On the Marvel side, it was not until 1964 that the first comic book entirely dedicated to a woman was published. 
                comics entirely dedicated to a woman. So they lost<span class="complex"> l'héritage </span>  
                This woman being Black Widow who started out as a villain before joining the good guys 
                was a villain before joining the good guy team. Captain Marvel or even 
                Scarlet witch, Tornado, Invisible Woman, Mystique or Gamora
                </p>

                </figure>


                <p>
                    Unfortunately at Marvel due to the late arrival of 
                    heroines, the essential feminists had already been won over by 
                    DC. This does not mean that they are losing their fight for gender equality in comics. 
                    equality within comics. It just means that the fight was already well underway. </p>
