        <h3>Gal Gadot</h3>
        <h3>Gal Gadot Qui est-ce ?</h3>
        <p>
            
            Gal Gadot is a famous actress, producer and model. Her acting debut took 
            place in her native Israel in 2007. Her career began to take an amazing turn 
            in 2009. She is known for her acting prowess having played in the Fast and Furious 
            franchise. But the main focus today is her superb role in Wonder Woman in 2017. 
            Having won the lead role she has had a real, impact on society and the Marvel and DC heroic 
            world combined. She will appear as the heroine for the first time in Batman v Superman Dawn of 
            Justice released in 2016

         <h3>Her struggle </h3> <p> 

            Her line "Feminism is not about burning bras, hating men or growing armpit hair. It is simply about
             EQUALITY between men and women. We should all be feminists! It makes us aware once again of the fight
              we should not forget. 
            She has worked with<span class="complex">#MeToo </span>  and <span class="complex">#SeeHer </span> 
             and received an award for it. The reason behind it all is her sense of justice and her actions have been numerous. From visits in disguise to colleges and various meeting places to meet young people. 
            In order to make them aware of the donations to certain <span class="complex"> associations. </span> </p>

        </figure>
        
        
        <p>  Her biggest struggle has been to increase the number of films made by women
             as a director, not for women but for the world. Recently she had an internal
              conflict with director Joss Whedon on the set of "Justice League" where she
               said he was disrespectful and threatened her career if she didn't shut up.
                But our dear Wonder Woman is not only disrespectful in the movies and does
                 not regret having denounced the latter's inappropriate attitude. Several
                  actors and actresses intervened to confirm these statements.

            <h3>The place of women in the media</h3><p>  

                More and more we can see that the image of women on the screens is changing. Thanks to women and men fighting to change 
                <span class="complex">stereotypical </span>images. Women like Gal Gadot , Emma Watson , Beyoncé , 
                Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Oprah Winfrey are needed. Because "feminist messages from artists 
                are even a good way to reach a different audience. . All these women are in different sectors on 
                the screen yet are all fighting for the same cause - equality and an end to inequality, stereotypes, 
                sexism and violence.
